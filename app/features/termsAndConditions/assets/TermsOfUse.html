  <body>
    <h1>Terms of Use and Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>The NZ Pass Verifier is a digital verification application ('app) made available by the New Zealand Ministry of Health ('we', 'us' or 'our'), and is designed to support the COVID-19 public health response in New Zealand.</p>

    <p>Any use of the app is subject to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>these terms of use;</li>
        <li>the Privacy Act 2020; and</li>
        <li>any Orders or other legal requirements under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 that may be in place governing the ability to require presentation of a COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate (a CVC), or verification of the CVC (collectively referred to as Orders).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>The app is for the purpose of scanning a My Vaccine Pass (the Pass) issued by us. The app is available to anyone who downloads or uses it. The app is intended to be used by businesses and other entities needing to verify vaccination and exemption status under the Orders, including the <a href="https://covid19.govt.nz/alert-levels-and-updates/covid-19-protection/">COVID-19 Protection Framework.</a></p>

    <p>NZ Pass Verifier will enable app users to verify a Pass as an authentic CVC record of vaccination or exemption. The app will display the name, date of birth and expiry date recorded in the QR Code of the Pass presented.</p>

    <p>You must use any personal information accessed by the app in accordance with the Privacy Act 2020 and in accordance with any Order requirements. The app may only be used in compliance with current Orders, and users are not permitted to collect and / or use information about the presenter of the Pass via the app for any unrelated purpose.</p>

    <p>No identifiable information about the user of the device or the Pass is retained by the app.</p>

    <p>Basic analytics events are captured to record the number of successful and unsuccessful scans that have occurred. These events do not contain any personal information and are not able to be linked to an individual or location. The app uses Amazon Pinpoint - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/">https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/</a> - for basic broad event collection, supporting simple reporting at country level. The events collected (by date) are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>number of valid scans</li>
        <li>number of invalid scans (by reason)</li>
        <li>number of installs or first opens</li>
        <li>demographic information about the app and device used, including the application version, device make, model, platform, and platform version</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The app requires the following permissions to be granted:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Internet/Wi-Fi State: Used to detect when the app is connected to the internet, in order to update the list of trusted pass issuers.</li>
        <li>Camera: Used to scan QR codes to verify a pass.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>

    <p>These terms of use and privacy policy apply to the entire contents of the app, to any web feeds produced by the app, any interactions you may have with the app, any use by you of the app and to any feedback or submissions provided back to the Ministry of Health.</p>

    <p>By downloading, viewing and/or using the app, you will be deemed to agree to these Terms of Use. If you choose to use this app, these terms will form an agreement between you and us.</p>

    <p>Your use of the app is governed by New Zealand Law.</p>

    <p>Any user that builds their own verification technology incorporating the app must comply with <a href="https://nzcp.covid19.health.nz/">the standards</a> published by the Ministry of Health.</p>

    <p>You must notify the service Contact Centre on 0800 222 478 or at <a href="mailto:help@mycovidrecord.min.health.nz">help@mycovidrecord.min.health.nz</a> immediately if you know or have reason to believe that there has been or is about to be fraudulent or other unlawful use of the app.</p>

    <p>Anyone who knowingly accesses or uses, or attempt to access or use, the app for an unlawful purpose (including but not limited to fraud or attempted fraud or hacking or attempted hacking), may be liable to prosecution under New Zealand Law.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

    <p>Except where we have an explicit legal obligation under New Zealand legislation we disclaim and exclude all liability for any claim, loss, demand or damages of any kind whatsoever (including for our negligence) arising out of or in connection with the use of either this app or the information, content or materials associated with this app or included on this app or on any website we link to.</p>

    <h2>Continuity of function</h2>

    <p>We make no warranty or representation, express or implied, as to continuity of function of the app. We reserve the right to suspend, terminate or otherwise alter access to some or all of the app at any time and without notice if we consider that:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>this is necessary to maintain the integrity or security of related capabilities; or</li>
        <li>we decide it is necessary for us to amend or alter the settings for the app; or</li>
        <li>we decide to remove or reduce the functions available in the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The app requires that you regularly connect to the internet to update the trusted verifiers list.</p>

    <p>The app will not continue to function if it has not been updated in the previous fourteen days.</p>

    <h2>Revisions of Terms</h2>

    <p>We may revise these Terms at any time. Revisions take effect when published to our website. </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>You must not modify, distribute, alter, tamper with, repair or otherwise create derivative works of the app unless expressly permitted.</p>

    <p>You must not reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the app or apply any other process or procedure to derive the source code of any software included in the app (except to the extent allowed by applicable law).</p>

    <p>The app is subject to independent security audits. If you discover a potential security vulnerability or suspect a security incident related to this app, you can report it to us following the <a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/digital-health/digital-health-sector-architecture-standards-and-governance/responsible-disclosure-guidelines">Responsible Disclosure</a> process.</p>
